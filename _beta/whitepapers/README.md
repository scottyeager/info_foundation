The technology stack is very advanced and uses very different concepts and archietctures to get things done that many (all) other software stacks.  This sections will allow people to get familiar with the differrent principles and architectual components used.

### The problem definition

The big challenges for Information Technology today are:
- Keep IT systems safe, protect against hackers.  Hackers are everywhere and just like in the real world malicious people are are something of us.  In the digital world it can be identity, reputation, money and data.
- Keep IT systems up & running. we have become so reliant of IT systems to be up and runniong that we no longer can afford system crashes.  Imagine the controls of a power plant to no longer function and that this power plant is no longer abke to deliver power to the grid. 
- IT systems and mode importantly archietcture have not been designed to be power (and resource) efficient. The power usage of datacenters and all of its complicated conponents is crazy (not very sustainable).  The increased demand make this worse as there if much more focus to build new and additional capacity than there is to make existing capacity more efficient.
- Data Privacy, Data Ownership and regulations put forwardward on this. Data is the new crude oil and it is everywhere therefore strong regulations are being put in place. 

### What are the Root Causes of these Challenges ?

#### Layers and Layers of Complexity

#### People (impossible to avoid mistakes, sometimes malicious intent)


#### IT Capacity is not available where the users need the capacity (edge)


At the core the TFTech technology is pushing Autonomous Information technology.  Most of what we refer to today as Information Technology is too complex to an average person to understand and work with which has created this 

#### Self Driving IT
people consensus driven = X people agree on deployment, 
		which “self drives” to an operational autonomous system
security = no hacking surface and ultra resilient data management

#### Self Healing IT
uptime = no people required to operate the IT system, system can recover and repair itself.


#### Sustainable IT
usage of natural resources (hardware, energy):
	10-100x benefit compared to others for storage & blockchain workloads
scalability: 
	grow to any scale required and use better algorithms to do more with less resources
data ownership and legislation:
	everyone owns their own data in full privacy & neutrality
