# ThreeFold Foundation

We are a decentralized movement. ThreeFold Foundation is the not-for-profit structure which has as its purpose to promote the ThreeFold Grid and movement as part of a greater ecosystem of organizations and individuals.

## History

In the earlier days of the ThreeFold Foundation there were multiple teams collaborating, but the core teams where located in Dubai and Belgium.

- In Dubai we had [ThreeFold FZC](threefold_fzc.md). This company was owned by Adnan & Kristof
- In Belgium we had [Bettertoken](bettertoken.md). This company was owned by Kristof and Kristof's Incubator

Adnan & Kristof started the ThreeFold idea (which is basically just a concept people can relate to or not) from the above-mentioned companies and have always acted in their respective capacity as directors of these companies. This structure would later evolve into the ThreeFold Foundation as it is known today. 

The original funding came from the fact that The ThreeFold Foundation has sold early capacity (in form of '(Internal) ThreeFold Tokens’, or ‘(i)TFTs’, together referred to as “TFTs”). These buyers could use their TFT to buy IT capacity from ThreeFold FZC or Bettertoken BV until April 2020, or from the ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid) directly in a fully decentralized way starting May 2020.

The TF Grid is the result of many independent farmers using the open source technology which is now on https://github.com/threefoldtech.

Originally, the technology used was created by three companies: GreenIT Globe, ThreeFold FZC, & [ThreeFold Tech](tftech.md). The last two still actively participate in creation of tech components used by all TF Farmers today.

## Genesis Pool

To kickstart the TF Grid back in 2017, ThreeFold FZC and [Bettertoken](bettertoken.md) committed large amounts of capacity to the grid. This was called the [Genesis Pool](genesis_pool.md) and the tokens sold as mentioned could be used to use capacity from this pool and more.

## Today (July 2020)

[ThreeFold Foundation VZW](threefold_vzw.md) (‘TF Foundation’) is a Belgian not-for-profit organization which owns 100% of the shares of Bettertoken BV and Threefold FZC, and which is governed by a group of people (also referred to as the “Wisdom Council.” See [ThreeFold Councils](threefold_.md).
