# ThreeFold Foundation 

We are a decentralized movement, ThreeFold Foundation is the not for profit structure which has as purpose to promote the ThreeFold grid and movement.
Not for profit means that no shareholder has the intent to ever use any of the benefits (if any) as created in ThreeFold Foundation.

## history 

In the earlier days of the ThreeFold there where multiple teams collaborating, but the 2 core teams where located in Dubai and Belgium.

- In Dubai we had: [ThreeFold FZC](threefold_fzc.md) = ThreeFold Foundation (*), this company was owned by Adnan & Kristof.
- In Belgium we had:[Bettertoken](bettertoken.md), this company was owned by Kristof and Kristof's Incubator (Incubaid)

Adnan & Kristof started the ThreeFold idea (which is basically just a concept people can relate to or not) from above mentioned companies 
and have always acted in their respective capacity as directors of these companies.  This structure would later evolve into the ThreeFold Foundation as it is known today.

The original funding came from the fact that The ThreeFold Foundation has sold early capacity (in form of ‘(Internal) ThreeFold Tokens’, or ‘(i)TFTs’, together referred to as “TFTs”). These buyers could use their TFT to buy IT capacity from ThreeFold FZC or Bettertoken BV until April 2020 or from the TFGrid directly in a fully decentralized way starting May 2020.

The ThreeFold Grid is the result of many independent farmers using the opensource technology which is now on https://github.com/threefoldtech.

Originally the technology used was created by 3 Companies: GreenIT Globe, ThreeFold FZC & [ThreeFold Tech](tftech.md). 
The last two still actively participate in creation of tech components used by all TF Farmers today.

(*) a new organization: [ThreeFold Foundation VZW](threefold_vzw.md) has been created in Belgium to become the new structure for our Foundation. Process is ongoing, see below.


## Status Today (July 2020)

[ThreeFold Foundation VZW](threefold_vzw.md) (‘TF Foundation’) is a Belgian non-for-profit organization which will own 100% of the shares of Bettertoken BV and Threefold FZC (the current TF Foundation), and which is governed by 9 people (also referred to as the “wisdom council” see [threefold councils](threefold_councils.md). 

Wisdom council first meeting needs to be held, process of acquiring the shares of TF FZC and BetterToken is ongoing, until this process is 100% completed and the Wisdom council is active ThreeFold FZC (Dubai) keeps on being the only working organization for ThreeFold Foundation. We will update this page when process completed.

## Genesis Pool

To kickstart the ThreeFold Grid back in 2017 ThreeFold FZC and [Bettertoken](bettertoken.md) committed large amounts of capacity to the grid. This was called the [Genesis Pool](genesis_pool.md) and the tokens sold as mentioned could be used to use capacity from this pool and more.
