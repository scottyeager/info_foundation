## Minting 

### v1.0 (april 2018)

- measurements done by secure measurement software part of Zero-OS
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v1.0
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of TFT for farming
- a technical board of at least 3 people always verified the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software
- the genesis pool was inserted at the launch date (april 2018) with all corresponding hardware availability reports
- each minting operating (farming) resulted in creating a verification hash of the capacity report and attaching it to the blockchain transaction which created the tokens (TFT).
 
 ### v2.0 (may 2020)
 
- measurements done by secure measurement software part of Zero-OS
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v2.0 
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of TFT for farming
- all capacity is non certified
- the [TFGrid Council](grid_council.md) verifies the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software
- each minting operating (farming) resulted in creating a verification hash of the capacity report and attaching it to the blockchain transaction which created the tokens (TFT).
 
 ### v2.x (Q3-Q4 2020)

 Is basically a set of improvements in how the code gets verified by technical people before it gets deployed.
 Each farmer has to accept any deployment or upgrade of Zero-OS.
 
- peer2peer capacity measurements done by smart contract for IT workload (unique feature for TFGrid)
- multiple versions of the smart contract of IT workloads are used (to get to consensus of the measurement)
- workload definition (smart contract for IT) signed by majority of the [Technology Council](technology_council.md)
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v2.0 and signed the measurement code which was signed by the [Technology Council](technology_council.md)
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of the tokens for farming
- capacity can be certified and not certified
- majority of 9 [TFGrid Council](grid_council.md) verify the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software and the correct procedure was followed
- when certified capacity the minting software compares with certification report (amount of resource units)
- each minting operating (farming) resulted in creating a verification hash of the capacity report and attaching it to the blockchain transaction which created the tokens (TFT).

We believe this is a very secure way how to measure capacity and use unique capabilities of our grid which is the smart contract for IT. 

### Future 

- hardware support for measurement / verification of capacity of farming nodes
- details to be defined
 
  
  
  > NO TFT HAVE EVER BEEN CREATED (MINTED) WITHOUT CORRESPONDING FARMING & AVAILABLE CAPACITY
