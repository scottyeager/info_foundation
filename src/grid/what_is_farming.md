# Farming: Putting Capacity Online On The ThreeFold Grid

## What is a Farmer?
The ThreeFold Grid is formed by ThreeFold farmers - individuals or businesses who connect compute and storage hardware (also known as servers) called 3Nodes to the ThreeFold Grid. The compute and storage capacity of 3Nodes mint [ThreeFold Tokens](token_what.md) for the Farmer as a reward. Once the farmerâ€™s capacity on the ThreeFold Grid gets reserved by a user he gets ThreeFold Tokens. This is called capacity cultivation income.

### Types of ThreeFold Farmers

There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers

- Certified Farmer: Buys certified hardware and signs a contract with ThreeFold Tech for support.
- Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.

Note that the ThreeFold Foundation's sole purposes is to ensure the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and its ecosystem according to it's vision and values. To fund these activites, a part of each transaction that pays TFTs for cultivation is going to the ThreeFold Foundation to finance the ThreeFold Grid's expansion and to fund projects that are believed to bring a positive human or planet impact.
