## Farming Reward Principles

TFT are only created (minted) when new capacity (storage & compute) is added to the ThreeFold Grid in the form of hardware. This done by [Farmers](become_a_farmer.md), ThreeFolds more sustainable equivalent of cryptocurrency miners.
Farming is calculated once a month, at the fist day of the next month.

[farming_logic](farming_logic)

As you can see, the amount of TFTs that are created by farmers depends on four variables:

**1. Proof-of-Capacity**

The server/Node specs of the Farmers hardware:

* Compute Capacity (CPU)
* Memory Capacity (RAM)
* Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

The performance/capability of this hardware is attributed with [Cloud Units](cloud_units.md) that then summarized to a [Cloud Production Rate (CPR)](cloud_production_rate.md) for the individual node. The higher the CPR, the more tokens are earned. Simply put, he more capable the hardware, the more TFTs are earned.

**2. Grid Specs (This is the same for all farmers at every point in time)**

* [Farming Difficulty](token_limitedsupply.md) (the actual difficulty factor determining how fast TFT’s are created through farming). Farming difficulty follows the logic of diminishing returns, meaning that over time, less and less TFT are earned. 


**3. The price of TFT in USD**

* To maximize the stability of farming returns, the amount of TFTs earned for farming is normalized against the US Dollar. That way farmers can enjoy a predictable rate of return even if the price of TFT would fall. At the same time the system ensures that farming profits are balanced and fair for everyone even in case of steep increases in [TFT valuation](tf_grid_valuation).  

> Disclaimer: Please note that we can´t and won´t make price predictions on TFT evaluation and all assumptions made here are purely hypothetical.

**4. Certification**

* Providing hardware reliably is rewarded with a certification that leads to increased earnings in TFT for certified farmers. We are currently in the creation process of a new certification program. Please follow our [Forum](forum.threefold.io)for the latest updates.


## Roadmap

### v1.0 (april 2018)

- measurements done by secure measurement software part of Zero-OS
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v1.0
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of TFT for farming
- a technical board of at least 3 people always verified the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software
- the genesis pool was inserted at the launch date (april 2018) with all corresponding hardware availability reports
- each minting operating (farming) resulted in creating a verification hash of the capacity report and attaching it to the blockchain transaction which created the tokens (TFT).
 
 ### v2.0 (may 2020)
 
- measurements done by secure measurement software part of Zero-OS
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v2.0 
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of TFT for farming
- all capacity is non certified
- the [TFGrid Council](grid_council.md) verifies the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software
- each minting operating (farming) resulted in creating a verification hash of the capacity report and attaching it to the blockchain transaction which created the tokens (TFT).
 
 ### v2.x (Q4 2020)

 Is basically a set of improvements in how the code gets verified by technical people before it gets deployed.
 Each farmer has to accept any deployment or upgrade of Zero-OS.
 
- peer2peer capacity measurements done by smart contract for IT workload (unique feature for TFGrid)
- multiple versions of the smart contract of IT workloads are used (to get to consensus of the measurement)
- workload definition (smart contract for IT) signed by majority of the [Technology Council](technology_council.md)
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v2.0 and signed the measurement code which was signed by the [Technology Council](technology_council.md)
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of the tokens for farming
- capacity can be certified and not certified
- majority of 9 [TFGrid Council](grid_council.md) verify the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software and the correct procedure was followed
- when certified capacity the minting software compares with certification report (amount of resource units)
- each minting operating (farming) resulted in creating a verification hash of the capacity report and attaching it to the blockchain transaction which created the tokens (TFT).
