# Farming Certification Program (summer 2020)

## farming projects where hardware has already been bought

Starting July 1 we can certify your existing hardware.

We will organize certification parties using KVM equipment (Keyboard Video Mouse) or IPMI in case of specific servers or onsite.

TF-Tech is doing the certification today, in future there will be more certification parties.

> Remark: once a farmer & 3nodes are certified, the 3nodes will be available in the certified node directory, from this moment onwards TFT will be farmed independent of the date and origin of the hardware. 

Cost price 

- 200 eur per server (storage or cpu node).
- 1,000 eur per farmer location for professional farmers (+3 nodes)

- suggest to use KVM equipment, if not possible then we are willing to travel to your site, travel & hotel costs will be charged.

## TF-Tech: additional services for farmers

- setup of farmer 3bot environment for custom billing purposes.
- setup of a marketplace based on e.g. https://www.whmcs.com/ and link to 3bot sdk, farmer can define create any custom solution build on top of the TFGrid.
- if certified management cards are available like HPE ilo5, the farmer can do power management and remote access to verify health of his farm 3nodes. TF-Tech can support to train & integrate these features.

## steps

- TF-Tech will create a [farming certification report](farming_certification_report.md) per farmer which will be publicly available.
- TF-Tech certification specialist will configure the bios with unique secret which is not available to anyone but the certification person who has strict confidentially contract signed. Multi signature is required between farmer and TF-Tech to be able to retrieve this secret if that would ever be required.
- TF-Tech specialist will check registration in the certified farming directory and assist the farmer if that would be required.

## new farming projects

- new hardware bought from certified partner
