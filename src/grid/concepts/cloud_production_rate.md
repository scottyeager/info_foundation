# Cloud Production Rate  (CPR)


The Cloud Production Rate (CPR) indicates how ‘productive’ a compute or server hardware platform is. The higher the CPR, the more capacity in form of compute and storage is added. 
This makes it simple for a non-tech farmer to select the best farming hardware for the budget available. It is similar to the hashrate a Bitcoin miner of for example.

To calculate the CPR are very simple and straightforward formula is used:

**CPR = 1.5 * the amount of Compute Units (CU) of the hardware + the amount of Storage Units (SU) of the hardware**


How CU and SU are composed and calculated can be found [here](cloud_units.md)
