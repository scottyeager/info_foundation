## In Wiki Simulator

Before jumping in to our wiki simulator we recommend watching our wiki simulation tutorial below:

See [simulator](simulator_configure.md)

## Do it yourself Simulator

If you're looking to simulate farming cases with more control over the parameters you will need access to the 3SDK (a cloud based version is coming soon!) All documentation around this topic can be found on the TFGrid Manual in the simulate section, see below.

## Check our TFGrid Manual

This is for our version 2.0 today (there is a 2.2. being released right now, July 2020)

Visit the [3SDK Wiki: TFGrid Manual](https://sdk.threefold.io/)

Besides simulating your farming cases, the 3SDK Wiki is here to help you with (is for version 2.0):

- Help you understand the ThreeFold Grid architecture into detail
- Installing the 3SDK
- Show you around on the admin panel of the 3SDK
- Deploying the ThreeFold Grid
- Farm Management & Setup
