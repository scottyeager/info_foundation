## Introduction

The goal of this document is to provide an end-to-end overview of the ThreeFold technology suite and its components. Please do not forget to read the two white papers mentioned below – they explain in more detail the capacity and autonomous layers. Of the three technology layers, the experience layer is yet under development and only available for early adopters.

Please do not hesitate to give us feedback. For us, the technology is now so natural that it is hard to see how this all comes across to a reader who has never heard about it. Any feedback would be very much welcomed. Thank you!
