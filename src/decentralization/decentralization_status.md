# Decentralization Status

![](./img/decentralization33.png)

We believe we are good under way to be a decentralized movement.

There are more than 100 independent active parties building the TFGrid today.

## good enough and available today

- token on a public blockchain, in this case Stellar, this provides very good security and decentralization for everyone
- token can be exchanged on Stellar decentralized exchange
- independent farmers, all capacity registered on TFDirectory and signed by Farmer node.
- ALL technology opensource and everyone can see progress, ask for feature requests, check/audit the code, ...
- The TFGrid IT workloads are distributed using the smart contract for IT (peer2peer with multi-signature capability)
- TFFoundation is promotion only (Mazraa which is subbrand is also a farmer)
- measurement of capacity done per 3node
- measurement of uptime done per 3node and distributed, should be good enough
- minting (creation of new code) all done by means of code and validated by ThreeFold team of 3 people.
- every minting operation since start of the blockchain creates a proof document
  - the hash is put in the transaction of the minting operation
  - means there is proof of every minting operation
- multi signature wallet for rewarding people with gifted TFT for contributions done
- autonomous TFTA/TFT conversion bot: each TFTA burned on Stellar automatically creates 1 TFT on Stellar
  - is only 1 process today (1 location)
  - there are reporting tools making sure that the conversion happens 100% correctly
- The Foundation & TFTech use a priority management tool to let everyone have input on priorities and manage work well (see circles.threefold.me)

## new Decentralization features in Summer 2020

- Not for profit structure with strong governance (ThreeFold Foundation as VZW in Belgium) and BetterToken/TF FZC report into it.
- 3 councils see [threefold_councils](threefold_councils.md) is like our human blockchain
  - signing using blockchain techno by ```TFGrid council``` for minting operation (is a control mechanism)
  - signing using blockchain techno for TF Foundation decisions required in relation to grid by ```TFGrid Council``` (6/9 votes required)
- new voting system for our TFT community, which allows everyone to be involved in certain decisions.
  - this voting system will also be used by our councils
- resell bot for TFTA to TFT on Stellar, Liquid and BTCAlpha runs autonomous using our smart contract for IT layer, multi signed by TFGrid council
- run the TFTA/TFT conversion bot (TFTA burning & TFT creation) by means of our smart contract for IT layer, multi signed by TFGrid council

*More info about suggested changes see update doc [tf update july 2020](threefold_update_july2020.md)*

## to improve in Q3/Q4 2020

### technical

- investigating if we can run the TFPhonebook & TFDirectory on a parity based blockchain on top of our BCDB, this would give ultra peer2peer behavior and performance
- peer verification of capacity between 3nodes, makes it harder to fake capacity (based on our flists and our smartcontract for IT)
- there is no measurement of bandwidth yet, so farmers cannot get money for this yet

### perception

- too many people perceive the foundation as centralized and having more power than which is reality.
- the foundation is only a promotion vehicle, need to make sure everyone understands this.
- some people have multiple hats on (e.g. Kristof works for TFFoundation and for TFTech), we believe there is no conflict of interest today because the "interest" is 100% aligned between TFTech and TFFoundation.
- we need to be more vocal about the fact that we are a community, its not some people dictating direction, we use our own priority management tool to coordinate on decisions.

### minting not 100% autonomous yet

- we are using code (software) to do all the minting (creation of tokens) and we could make this autonomous but the TF Foundation believes its better for now to have a human blockchain doing a double check.
- The minting code is opensource and can be found in the code repos.
- we hope that by the end of the year it can happen 100% decentralized without human checks (was the TFGrid Council today)

> DISCLAIMER: the checks as done by our TFGrid Council does not imply any guarantee or impose any liabilities on THreeFold Foundation of any of the related parties.
