# Decentralization Status

![](./img/decentralization33.png)

We believe we are good under way to be a decentralized movement.

There are more than 100 independent active parties building the TFGrid today.

## good enough and available today

- token on a public blockchain, in this case Stellar, this provides very good security and decentralization for everyone
- token can be exchanged on Stellar decentralized exchange
- independent farmers, all capacity registered on TFDirectory and signed by Farmer node.
- ALL technology opensource and everyone can see progress, ask for feature requests, check/audit the code, ...
- The TFGrid IT workloads are distributed using the smart contract for IT (peer2peer with multi-signature capability)
- TFFoundation is promotion only (Mazraa which is sub-brand is also a farmer)
- measurement of capacity done per 3node
- measurement of uptime done per 3node and distributed, should be good enough
- minting (creation of new code) all done by means of code and validated by ThreeFold team of 3 people.
- every minting operation since start of the blockchain creates a proof document
  - the hash is put in the transaction of the minting operation
  - means there is proof of every minting operation
- multi signature wallet for rewarding people with gifted TFT for contributions done
- autonomous TFTA/TFT conversion bot: each TFTA burned on Stellar automatically creates 1 TFT on Stellar
  - is only 1 process today (1 location)
  - there are reporting tools making sure that the conversion happens 100% correctly
- The Foundation & TFTech use a priority management tool to let everyone have input on priorities and manage work well (see circles.threefold.me)
- There is a validation tool which everyone can execute to check the conversion between the version of TFT, this code is on https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tft-stellar

## new Decentralization features in Summer 2020

- today our TFT has been designed to be super decentralized, while we fully support this we are also doing an investigation how to become a licensed utility token in multiple jurisdictions
  - this could have an impact how to organize our Foundation, we are talking with legal parties in 4 jurisdictions (start Aug): US, CH, Lichtenstein & UAE (Dubai).
- engineers came up with a new system which provides good decentralization in relation to minting & token conversion, details will be provided very soon and will be in line with requirement for licensed utility token.
- 3 councils see [threefold_councils](threefold_councils.md) is like our human blockchain
  - (ALMOST DONE)
- new voting system for our TFT community, which allows everyone to be involved in certain decisions (DONE).
  - this voting system will also be used by our councils
  - first voting  process has been done quite succesful

*More info about suggested changes see update doc [tf update july 2020](threefold_update_july2020.md)*

## to improve in Q3/Q4 2020

### technical

- investigating if we can run the TFPhonebook & TFDirectory on a parity based blockchain on top of our BCDB, this would give ultra peer2peer behavior and performance
- peer verification of capacity between 3nodes, makes it harder to fake capacity (based on our flists and our smartcontract for IT)
- there is no measurement of bandwidth yet, so farmers cannot get money for this yet

### perception

- too many people perceive the foundation as centralized and having more power than which is reality.
- the foundation is only a promotion vehicle, need to make sure everyone understands this.
- some people have multiple hats on (e.g. Kristof works for TFFoundation and for TFTech), we believe there is no conflict of interest today because the "interest" is 100% aligned between TFTech and TFFoundation.
- we need to be more vocal about the fact that we are a community, its not some people dictating direction, we use our own priority management tool to coordinate on decisions.

### minting is based on census of people

- We are using code (software) to do all the minting (creation of tokens) and we could make this autonomous but the TF Foundation believes its better for now to have a human blockchain doing a double check.
- The minting code is opensource and can be found in the code repos.
- We found out that this actually a requirement for the possibility to become a licensed utility token in certain regions.
