# Threefold Grid Council

Guardians are the members of the Grid Council. There are 9 of them.

Together they take the required decisions for the ThreeFold Grid-related (non-technical) day-to-day activities.

## What is it

* The Grid Council is the group of people doing the day-to-day management for ThreeFold Grid-related decisions.
* Some examples of decisions which need to be taken:
    * Approving the minting operation (signing)
    * Approving day to day decisions (e.g. remuneration for people who helped the ThreeFold aka token salary)
    * Approving new partners of the Alliance for a Conscious Internet
    * Approving of the members of the [ThreeFold Technology Council](technology_council.md)
    * Approval of polls done with community
    * Approval of any fundamental change for any of the grid operational items
* The Grid Council has been approved by the [Wisdom Council](wisdom_council.md)
    * Each guardian was interviewed by the council and approved to align with "fit for duty requirements"
    * This approval cycle will happen in Summer 2020

## Relation with the Wisdom Council

* Wisdom Council is managing the Foundation, this only happens couple of times per year.
    * Budgets
    * Approval of directors
    * The Foundation is a "VZW" in Belgium which is an official not for-profit structure
* Grid council is day-to-day operation

## Fit for duty requirements

* There is no ego involved by being a guardian.
    * We realize our own reason to be a guardian is to be at the service of our community and the planet.
* We work on self-development.
    * We realize we know nothing and are nothing but will always work in the best interest of the planet. The more we learn the less we know. 
    * We don’t blame others, change starts with ourselves.
    * We see the benefit of self-improvement work (e.g. meditation, self-reflection, sessions with energy healer / spiritual coach)
* We are not addicted to 
    * Sex, Food, Substances, Gambling, Power, Money
    * Our definition of addiction:
        * We can make decisions without being influenced because of the desire for one of the above-mentioned topics.
        * We are not depending on one of the above to feel happy.
* We really believe the values as described on our FreeFlow Nation.
    * [https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html](https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html)
    * We know them, we understand them, & we agree with them.
* If we have a shortcoming in one of the above, we are not afraid to be open about it and express our desire to improve on it.
* Technical:
    * We are able & willing to use digital currency wallets, Github (or alternative), wiki text, etc
    * We are willing to actively use the circle’s tool (circles.threefold.me)
* We are willing to be a Guardian for at least 2 years starting with our submission.
