    * We realize our own reason to be a guardian is to be at the service of our community and the planet.

* Work on self-development

    * Realize we know nothing and are nothing but will always work in the best interest of the planet. The more we learn the less we know. 

    * Don’t blame others, change starts with ourselves.

    * We actively work on our own self-development (meditation, self-reflection, sessions with energy healer / spiritual coach, …)

    * Our definition of addiction

* We really believe the values as described on our freeflow nation.

    * [https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html](https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html)

(if not we say what to change now)

* If we have a shortcoming in one of the above we are not afraid to be open about it and express our desire to improve on it.
