Following the true decentralized nature of ThreeFold we have instated 3 different councils to make decisions in regards to Foundation, Technology, & The Grid.

## [Technology Council](technology_council.md)

The ThreeFold Project is heavily depending of technology and thus there is a Technology Council.
This council is involved in the technology decisions that are to be made e.g. validation of software, upgrades.

## [Grid Council](grid_council.md)

This council is made up of 9 people involved in the decision making in regards to the ThreeFold Grid and projects related to the Grid.
The Grid Council will also be the main touchpoint with and for the ThreeFold Community.
