# ThreeFold Councils

![](./img/wisdom_council.png)

Following the true decentralized nature of ThreeFold we have instated 3 different councils to make decisions in regards to Foundation, Technology, & the Grid.

## [Wisdom Council](wisdom_council.md)

The ThreeFold Foundation requires protection from an impartial group and guidance when it comes to allocation of funds.

## [Grid Council](grid_council.md)

The ThreeFold Movement needs decision-making in regards to the ThreeFold Grid and projects related to the Grid. The Grid Council will also be the main touch-point with and for the ThreeFold Community.

## [Technology Council](technology_council.md)

The ThreeFold Project is heavily dependent on technology and thus there is a Technology Council. This council is involved in the day-to-day technology decisions that are to be made.
