12 members have following function

- protect the interests of the ThreeFold Foundation
- approve TFT donations to doing good projects
- oversee the way how the ThreeFold tokens are used to benefit the planet and the ThreeFold movement.
- give their approval over members of TFGrid council (guidance only)

In order to make balanced, fair and effective decisions regarding ThreeFold Foundation funds distribution, ThreeFold Foundation has adopted the Wisdom Council system as a resource model of harmonious communication

This process is based upon ancient leadership practices and modern social science techniques as a way to consider all perspectives of the Members in order to make decisions that are in the greatest interest of the Mission and for the good of all.

## Mission

Financially support consciously aligned do-good projects and organizations.
Protect the interests of the ThreeFold vision and mission.

## Members

Wisdom Council Members are community leaders chosen by Founders Circle due to their honorable integrity and exemplary service related to The Mission. Structure and balance of Member Seats is based on one's personal role, strength, purpose, archetypes and other respectful characteristics.

## Responsibility

Based upon the ageless principles of the Wisdom Council equation, Members will converge (online or live when possible) to discuss and vote upon the distribution of funds from ThreeFold Foundation to pre-approved and/or pre-selected do-good projects and organizations.

## Process

The [grid council](grid_council.md) prepares all the decisions to be taken by the wisdom council.
When a meeting is required they grid council will organize.
The voting happens using blockchain technology and is done by all wisdom council members.
