ThreeFold Foundation receives through the blockchain 10% of all capacity sold on the Threefold Grid. These proceeds are used to further develop the ThreeFold Movement and later to benefit planetary doing good projects.

12 members have following function:

- Protect the interests of the ThreeFold Foundation
- Approve TFT grants to do-good projects
- Oversee the way the Foundation's ThreeFold Tokens are used to benefit the planet and the ThreeFold Movement

In order to make balanced, fair, and effective decisions regarding ThreeFold Foundation's funds distribution, ThreeFold Foundation has adopted the Wisdom Council system as a resource model of harmonious communication.

This process is based upon ancient leadership practices and modern social science techniques as a way to consider all perspectives of the members in order to make decisions that are in the greatest interest of the mission and for the good of all.

## Mission

Financially support consciously aligned do-good projects and organizations.

## Members

Wisdom Council members are community leaders chosen by Founders Circle due to their honorable integrity and exemplary service related to The Mission. Structure and balance of Member Seats is based on one's personal role, strength, purpose, archetypes, and other respectful characteristics.

## Responsibility

Based upon the ageless principles of the Wisdom Council equation, members will converge (online or live when possible) to discuss and vote upon the distribution of funds from ThreeFold Foundation to pre-approved and/or pre-selected do-good projects and organizations.

## Process

The Wisdom Council members will be notified once per quarter as to the current do-good requests and account financial status to decide when to meet in regards to making distribution decisions on how much, when, and to whom the agreed funds go.
