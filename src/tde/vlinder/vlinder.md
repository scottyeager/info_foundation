*The Vlinder* is a private finance app providing a helicopter view of your payments, crypto wallets, and cash expenses while automatically estimating your carbon footprint allowing to contribute to community projects and make a profit from offsetting CO2 emissions by investing in green products with high return.

### Purpose

COVID-19 mitigation is a great example of what can be done when we act together. Vlinder helps people become more mindful about their consumption behaviour and investments and empowers to act on climate change. If we join forces, we can face any challenge, even climate change.
