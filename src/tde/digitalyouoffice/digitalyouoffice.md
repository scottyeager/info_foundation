# Project: 3Bot Office

![](3botdemo_slides.png)

To enable 3Bot Office, we integrated with [onlyoffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) for this, which is in our opinion the best made office solution that gets close the above cited criteria. Only Office is open-source (which we use today) but we also want to make a license deal with them to cater for support and allow even enterprises to use this on a larger scale. 

### Purpose

The purpose of 3Bot Office is to deliver an online office environment that is 100% integrated with your 3bot only 100% private to you. Millions of people are looking for a neutral office solution which is:
- neutral 
- allows you to own all your data
- faster, simple to use
- cost-effective
- able to work everywhere
- has advanced features like real time collaboration

### Status

- We have a full blown first version active and ready to be launched.
- We are now fundraising to make the next generations.

### 3Bot Office experience will be on 3bot
