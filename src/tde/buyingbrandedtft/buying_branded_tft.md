# Buying Branded TFT

## Step 1: Going from FIAT money into digital currencies

If you are new to buying digital currencies, this step is for you as you are about to step into the world digital currencies. (excited!)

For this example we will use a well known and renowned digital currency exchange that has a gateway from FIAT to digital currencies: www.Coinbase.com

1. Create an account on the sign up page : [https://www.coinbase.com/signup](https://www.coinbase.com/signup)![image alt text](./img/tde_buy_branded_image_0.png)

2. After signing up a few steps will be presented. Like GDPR compliance notice, privacy policy acknowledgment, and newsletter preferences.

8. For uploading purposes there are 3 options; webcam, phone camera & file upload. For this example we have used the webcam option to send both the fron and back of the ID.

## Exchanging your FIAT for digital currency.

For ease of trading we are buying XLM (Stellar) tokens. This makes steps to come easier.
