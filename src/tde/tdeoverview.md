# Token Distribution Event For ThreeFold Grid Use Cases

> _Note: If you're interested in participating in the Token Distribution Event, please visit the Token section of this wiki, and in particular "How to Buy."_

### Introduction

The TFT is the token of the new internet and has been created 2 years ago. ThreeFold Farmers have been providing a lot of capacity since then.

We did not do any ICO or other token creation event. Every token is the result of farming of Internet capacity.

We started with our token on our own blockchain but have now moved to the Stellar payment network. ThreeFold Farmers have donated 70m TFT to our Foundation.

We are organizing a Token Distribution Event on Stellar and 2 public digital currency exchanges (Liquid and BTC-Alpha), to benefit projects (listed below) which have as purposes to provide value to the ThreeFold movement and to do good for our planet.

### Project Funding

You can buy our ThreeFold Token on 2 public exchanges (Liquid and BTC-Alpha), existing farmers or through Stellar. By buying tokens, you directly support these projects and therefore the growth of the ThreeFold Grid and its experiences.

Its very easy to [buy these TFTs](how_to_buy_and_sell.md) and as such become part of the larger ThreeFold experience.

*Note: This image still needs to be updated to include Money of Good token.*

### How Does It Work

You can [buy](how_to_buy_and_sell.md) TFT directly or you can also choose to buy a token directly for a specific project, this allows you to decide where the benefit goes of your TFT purchase. 

Each branded TFT is exactly the same as the original TFT. It's just a different name for the same token, but the benefit of your purchase on the Stellar exchange goes directly to the wallet of that specific project.

Any non-branded TFTs purchased during the TDE will be distributed according to the pie chart above.
Please do note, we are on public exchanges where the Foundation offers these TFT at 0.15USD during May & June, any other TFT owner can also sell at their own conditions.

There will be a maximum of 70m TFT tradable during that period.

> This is not an ICO or IEO, all tokens are the result of previous farming (mining) activities done by the ThreeFold farmers and sold on public Exchanges.
