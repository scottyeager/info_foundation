# Project: Crystal Twin

![](https://www.consciousinternet.org/threefold/info/projects/crystal_twin/crystal_twin.png)

*The Crystal Twin's* vision is to shape a conscious digital world where all individuals, across regions, have equal chances to learn, partake, and succeed, in the best environment possible. A digital world where freedom and liberalism are at the center, and where we live sustainably and think circularly. The priority is to ensure the best environment possible for humanity to interact. The circular economies will be created to use resources consciously and to have true values at the core. Future economies will be digital and promote sustainability.

### Purpose

While Crystal Twin may seem like a technological solution, its roots and aim is strongly humanitarian. Every person who signs up for Crystal Twin makes a significant impact. The peer-to-peer infrastructure is up to 10x more efficient and sustainable and ensures data privacy and security is preserved. The internet cost is less than half a dollar a month per user, greatly increasing access to under-served communities. Additionally, the Crystal Twin ecosystem is creating a number of peer-to-peer experiences (new approach to applications) and solutions such as video conferencing, file storage and social networking that will impact both the effectiveness and security of online interactions.

### Status Today

A first [website](https://3bot.org/) has been created to showcase the idea, an updated version is coming up.

Objectives:
- Deliver an app which replaces our full digital life as we know it
- See project [Digital You](digitalyou.md) as a v1.0 of Crystal Twin

Crystal Twin lives on the TF Grid, serving as the gateway to the new digital world, to the new internet and peer-to-peer experiences. By using SDK, Crystal Twin users could create their own experiences, functionalities and features within the TF Gridâ€™s peer-to-peer ecosystem. Crystal Twin represents a bridge between the TF Grid and the full power of autonomous technology to deploy decentralized applications.
