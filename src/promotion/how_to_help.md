# How You Can Help!

Want to help spread the word but not quite sure how? In the end, you know yourself, your skill sets, and your network, the best, so we encourage you to consider that in this process. But here are some recommendations:

## Spread the Word!

We have a few places where you can find regular / updated content:

- [Website](https://www.threefold.io)
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/ThreeFold.io)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/threefold-foundation/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/threefold_io) 
- [Blog](https://blog.threefold.io)
- [Announcement Telegram Group](https://t.me/threefoldnews)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/ThreeFoldFoundation)
- [Forum](https://forum.threefold.io)

_If you're on Telegram, we also have a group there where we exclusively share out recent news. Join [here](https://t.me/joinchat/KfndwRSiOGjLU2OQsla8Ng)._

Please follow along and feel free to share with your networks when you are inspired to do so. Remember it's always best to add a line of text or two when you share the post rather than just hitting "share now." If you don't know what we're talking about, reach out to spreadtheword@threefold.io and we'll walk you through it.

Additionally, we have [a folder in this section](threefold_content.md) with shareable content you can simply download and post on your social network or messaging platform of choice.

## Look at promotion activities planned, see if you can help

## Introduce Someone Specific to ThreeFold

While blasting your network might be effective, we'd really recommend thinking about who specifically in your circles would be interested in what we are building, and getting in touch with them one-on-one.

Are you connected with people who want to do good for the planet? Make sure they know about the challenges of today's Internet and the reasons [why we're doing what we're doing](https://threefold.io/why.html). Encourage them to follow along and spread the word with their own networks. Do you know developers or IT professionals? Invite them to check out our [peer-to-peer cloud](https://cloud.threefold.io). Have any friends who are journalists or run podcasts? We'd love to talk with them (spreadtheword@threefold.io). 

We believe heavily in the network effect. Say for example that there are 5,000 people in our community. If each existing person introduced even just one new person each week to ThreeFold, and then they all did the same the following week, we'd have 80,000 people in our community in one month.

- Week 1: 5,000 existing + 5,000 new = 10,000 total
- Week 2: 10,000 existing + 10,0000 new = 20,000 total
- Week 3: 20,000 existing + 20,000 new = 40,000 total
- Week 4: 40,000 existing + 40,000 new = 80,000 total

You know best how to get in touch with the people in your circles so we'll leave it to you. But again, we're here to help if you're stuck!

## Help Us Form a New Partnership

We believe strongly that partnerships are the way forward. We have built a responsible solution / foundation for conscious organizations. Dozens of organizations have already signed on or expressed their intent to sign on to move to and/or build on top of the ThreeFold Grid â€“ and we invite more to do the same.

## Create Your Own Content

Feel particularly passionate about what we are doing? We'd love for you to create your own content about ThreeFold. That might sound scary but it can be as simple as writing a few lines of text or recording yourself talking into the camera for a few minutes and sharing it out on your preferred outlet or network.

If you don't know where to share, we invite you to create content for the [ThreeFold Blog](https://blog.threefold.io) as well. Or give us content ideas for our social channels.

## Seek Out New Communities

There are many groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, for example, that would and should be interested in what we are building. All it takes is a bit of digging to find them. Once you do, introduce yourself and share a bit about ThreeFold. Tap into what the group or community is all about.

Importantly, PLEASE avoid "spamming" as much as possible (just blasting about ThreeFold without any context, or posting across many groups at the same time).
