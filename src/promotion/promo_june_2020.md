# Awareness Campaign June-July 2020

## Purpose

- TFT sales for funding [Token Distribution Event = TDE](tdeoverview.md)
- Farming: 10.000 new nodes on the ThreeFold Grid.

> Its time to find funding for the ThreeFold project <BR>
> Its time to mobilize our communities (ambassadors, alliance for conscious internet, ...) <BR>
> Its time to startup our Farmer Programs again.
> **Its NOT time for finding liquidity for our farmers or early TFT buyers**

## Status

- TFGrid = the network of capacity
    - TFGrid 2.0 is life (see [releasenotes](sdk:releasenotes.md)
    - TFGrid 2.1 will be delivered in June (see [roadmap](roadmap.md))
- TFT2.0 has been released on Stellar, BTCAlpha & Liquid

> Do not expect lots of liquidity to happen in next months, we expect organic growth. <BR>
> We do not hype for crypto gamblers on exchanges, we hope they will not use us for speculation purposes. <BR>

## Plan

Organic growth of our project.

### BlockChain, P2P & SAAS Projects

- Missing Layer For Blockchain, P2P & SAAS projects
- purpose
    - support our project, tell their community about us
    - drive usage: use capacity on the TFGrid
- examples
    - blockchain: harmony, tomochain, ...
    - saas: icewarp, ...
    - P2P: Ankr, IPFS, HyperDrive, ...
- details are on wiki page
- PR: through existing blockchain/P2P channels (we have partners/friends helping us)
- expectations
    - its organic growth, don't expect this to use all our capacity < 12 months
- THIS IS THE ONLY APPROACH WE MAKE PR ABOUT BETWEEN JUNE 1 & JUNE 15
- centralized demo market place (launch mid June)
    - login on centralized marketplace (with 3bot connect)
    - deploy through a wizard the demo workloads (max nr of times per 3bot connect)
    - we get report from who did it, runs 7 days and only small capacity (is demo only)

### Farming

- 10.000 nodes in the field in 2020
- requirements
    - as distributed as possible
    - good connection to internet
    - certified hardware (so at least security of the hardware)
    - needs to be made all very simple, how to buy (through TFT)
- how
    - collect interested parties: now (more visible on website) = form
    - some big projects will drive faster adoption
    - sell boxes through Dubai & Belgium (phase more partners e.g. in US): there is some margin in there for Foundation
    - need easy web based simulator (hardware boxes have defined CU/SU -> need to show possible return visualization)
    - make sure people understand we deliver per 100 boxes (in batches)
- timing: launch June 15 (Monday)
