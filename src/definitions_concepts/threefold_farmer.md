## ThreeFold Farmer

TF Farmers farm ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by connecting hardware to the ThreeFold Grid.

As a result of farming, Internet capacity is generated and made available on the ThreeFold Grid Directory.

A Farmer earns tokens in 2 ways:
- Farming: as a result of connecting server/storage hardware to the ThreeFold Grid
- Cultivation: as a result of their Farming Pool capacity being utilised (sold) by ThreeFold Grid Capacity users

There are two types of capacity farmers:

- Certified Farmers: A certified hardware using farmer that has entered into, and is compliant with, the present Terms of the TFTech Service Level Agreement.
- DIY Farmers: Use their own choice of hardware (uncertified hardware).
