## Creation of TFTs

TFT are only created (minted) when new capacity (storage & compute) is added to the ThreeFold Grid in the form of hardware. This done by [Farmers](become_a_farmer.md), ThreeFolds more sustainable equivalent of cryptocurrency miners.
Farming is calculated once a month, at the fist day of the next month.

The amount of TFTs that are created by farmers depends on four variables:

**1. Proof-of-Capacity**

The server/Node specs of the Farmers hardware:

* Compute Capacity (CPU)
* Memory Capacity (RAM)
* Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

The performance/capability of this hardware is attributed with [Cloud Units](cloud_units.md) that then summarized to a [Cloud Production Rate (CPR)](cloud_production_rate.md) for the individual node. The higher the CPR, the more tokens are earned. Simply put, he more capable the hardware, the more TFTs are earned.

**2. Grid Specs (This is the same for all farmers at every point in time)**

* [Farming Difficulty](token_limitedsupply.md) (the actual difficulty factor determining how fast TFT’s are created through farming). Farming difficulty follows the logic of diminishing returns, meaning that over time, less and less TFT are earned. 


**3. The price of TFT in USD**

* To maximize the stability of farming returns, the amount of TFTs earned for farming is normalized against the US Dollar. That way farmers can enjoy a predictable rate of return even if the price of TFT would fall. At the same time the system ensures that farming profits are balanced and fair for everyone even in case of steep increases in [TFT valuation](tf_grid_valuation).  

> Disclaimer: Please note that we can´t and won´t make price predictions on TFT evaluation and all assumptions made here are purely hypothetical.

**4. Certification**

* Providing hardware reliably is rewarded with a certification that leads to increased earnings in TFT for certified farmers. We automatically measure uptime, bandwidth and the utilization of the node for [certification](farming_program.md).

This visualization encompasses all information that is relevant for the farming process that is creating TFT. The whole process is made **transparent and reliable with Blockchain-like immutability** through our Blockchain Database BCDB.
