## De<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">central</span>ized = Different centralized

Decentralized has the word centralized inside, but in a different way. The idea is not to make an organization or group of people the owner of a centralized system but rather the other way around – you or any legal identity becomes the center of your own digital life.

Each human person or other legal entity (can be a trust, a company, or a government department) owns one 3Bot. This is the main 3Bot you interact with, and this 3Bot can own other 3Bots.

3Bots are the actors inside such a system. All data is owned **only** by 3Bots who are **owned** by the aforementioned human or legal entities. All 3Bots need to be registered in a digital phone book (implemented by means of blockchain technology).

Each entity (human or legal) can define multiple circles. These circles define how we interact with other 3Bots (access rights, searchability, etc).
