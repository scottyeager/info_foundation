# The path from TFT v1 towards TFT v2

## Quick history overview

- More than 10 years ago this project started from out of our incubator see https://www.incubaid.com
- Almost 4 years ago TF Foundation Dubai started deploying capacity for development purposes
    - this became our ([our genesis pool](genesis_pool.md)), which is the beginning of farming
    - in 2017-18 value of the genesis pools were about 7m USD in TFT (tokens did not exist yet)  
    - Genesis pools are owned by ThreeFold Foundation (ThreeFold FZC Dubai).
- A little over 2 years ago (March 2018) our first-generation blockchain for the Threefold Token saw the daylight. 
    - The TFT v1 was launched on a blockchain called Rivine (PTO).
    - The genesis pool resulted in the first batch initial TFT.
    - The blockchain nodes were hosted by +30 different parties completely unrelated to each other.
- A little over a year ago (Q2 2019) TF Foundation Dubai launched our generation 1 of our TF Grid.
- April 2020 TF Foundation Dubai [launched the TFGrid v2.0](threefold_grid_2_0.md) which is now public and usable by the world.
    - TF Foundation Dubai has a new website and a new wiki (https://wiki.threefold.io)
    - a manual on how to use the TF Grid 2.0 (see https://sdk.threefold.io).
    - the cloud itself is on https://cloud.threefold.io
    - the farmers & TFT token holders have at own will upgraded their wallets, zero-nodes, ... 
- May 2020: TF Foundation Dubai launched our 2nd version of our token called TFT but this time on Stellar
    - the original TFTv1 kept all same properties and benefits and is now called TFTA also on Stellar
    - TF Foundation Dubai has provisioned the TFTv1 & TFTv2 on Stellar blockchain, but has no influence or access to any of the wallets or for that matter the 3nodes (The boxes providing IT capacity)
    - see below for more info, this was the result of 12 months of work with our community and of-course consensus to do this.
