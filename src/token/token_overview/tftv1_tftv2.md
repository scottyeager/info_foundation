# The path from TFT v1 towards TFT v2

## Quick history overview

- More than 10 years ago this project started from out of our incubator see https://www.incubaid.com
- Almost 4 years ago we started deploying capacity for development purposes
    - this became our ([our genesis pool](genesis_pool.md)), which is the beginning of farming
    - in 2017-18 value of the genesis pool was about 7m USD in TFT 
- A little over 2 years ago (March 2018) our first-generation blockchain for the Threefold Token saw the daylight. 
    - The TFT v1 was launched on a blockchain called Rivine.
    - The genesis pool was the start of that effort
- A little over a year ago (Q2 2019) we launched our generation 1 of our TF Grid. 
- April 2020 we [launched our TFGrid v2.0](threefold_grid_2_0.md) which is now public and usable by the world.
    - We have a new website, a new wiki (https://wiki.threefold.io)
    - a manual on how to use the TF Grid 2.0 (see https://sdk.threefold.io).
- May 2020: we launched our 2nd version of our token called TFT but this time on Stellar
    - the original TFTv1 kept all same properties and benefits and is now called TFTA also on Stellar
    - see below for more info, this was the result of 12 months of work with our community and of-course consensus to do this.
