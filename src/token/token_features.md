### Planet Friendly
No mining, Tokens are generated by adding active internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. TFT nodes are driven by an open-source operating system which produces energy efficient Internet capacity. By employing Stellar technology, TFT transactions and smart contracts are powered by one of the most energy-efficient blockchains available.

### Decentralized Issuance
TFTs are exclusively generated when new capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. There are no centralized issuers. Tokens have not been created out of thin air.
