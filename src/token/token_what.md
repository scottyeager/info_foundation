# What are ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)?

The ThreeFold Token is the currency of the new Internet. It is a decentralized digital currency that represents  a unit of reservation of capacity (compute, storage) on the largest peer-to-peer network of capacity on earth. This new Internet is built by independent farmers, who dedicate hardware to provide the necessary storage and compute. 

You can learn more about farming [here](what_is_a_farmer.md). 

### Where do TFTs come from?

When farmers connect hardware to the [ThreeFold Grid](grid_what.md), they farm (mine) TFT. 

> TFT are only created (minted) by TF Opensource Minting software as result of capacity being connected to the Internet, this process is called farming.

### Is there a demand for TFT?

See [this explanation](token_liquidity.md) about how the ThreeFold Grid generates a natural economic demand for TFT.

### A circular token economy

The following info graphic illustrates the circular economy of the ThreeFold Token. 

Note that the ThreeFold Foundation's sole purposes is to ensure the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and its ecosystem according to it's vision and values. To fund these activites, a part of each transaction that pays TFTs for cultivation is going to the ThreeFold Foundation to finance the ThreeFold Grid's expansion and to fund projects that are believed to bring a positive human or planet impact.
