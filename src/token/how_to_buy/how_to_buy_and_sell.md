# Multiple options for buying & selling ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)

Hi, there! It's nice to see you in this section of the wiki. Thank you for your support! If you would like more information on how buying the token helps ThreeFold, you can find that [here](tdeoverview.md).

*If you have any questions throughout, please feel free to use the support chat or ask on [our forum](https://forum.threefold.io). Thanks!*

### How to Buy

You have three options for buying the token right now:

1. From a public exchange *(some country limitations)*
2. Directly from a ThreeFold Farmer
3. Through Stellar's Decentralized Exchanges

For TFT, you can use any of the three options. If you want to buy branded TFT, you must use the third option (Stellar).

**If you have experience with digital currencies,** we recommend you go through one of the public exchanges if those are available in your country. Another option are Stellar Decentralized Exchanges.

**If you do not have experience with digital currencies,** you can either buy directly from a farmer or you can find some instructions within to help you through the process of signing up for and utilizing exchanges. *Keep in mind buying digital currencies through exchanges does involve some steps and time, but in the end this is because there is an exchange of money happening – so security, verification of identity, and related procedures are quite important.*

**Also, feel free to check out our ["New to Tokens"](newtotokens.md) section.**

### How to Sell

If you would like to, you can sell (or trade) TFT by using either of the public exchanges mentioned above or the Stellar DEX.

- You can get back to fiat currency by doing the reverse of what you did to buy your TFT
- You'll first need to trade your TFT with one of the trading pairs (BTC, USD, USDT, XLM)
- Then, you'll need to trade one of the trading pairs for the fiat of your choosing
- Finally, you can move that fiat back to your bank account
