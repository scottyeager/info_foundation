# Guide: Going From Fiat to TFT
We have created an easy-to-follow guide with 5 short sections on how to go from fiat currency (e.g. euros, dollars, or other government-issued currency) into digital currencies.

## **Step 1: Use an Exchange to Buy XLM with Fiat**

### [Chapter 1: Signing up for an exchange with a fiat gateway](coinbase_onboarding.md)
In this chapter, we show step-by-step how to sign up for Coinbase, a well-known and respected exchange that allows you to convert fiat into digital currency. Feel free to use any exchange platform with a fiat gateway, but this guide is specifically related to Coinbase.

### [Chapter 2: Adding funds to your wallet & exchanging to XLM](coinbase_funding_exchange.md)
A quick how-to to help you get your fiat currency into your fiat wallet on Coinbase.

####  If you already have XLM you can skip to [step 2](fiat_to_tft_step_2.md) to see the last 3 chapters.

> Important note: TFTs are not an investment instrument, TFTs are used to buy and sell IT capacity.
