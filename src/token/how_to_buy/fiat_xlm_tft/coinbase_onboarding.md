If you are new to buying digital currencies, this step is for you as you are about to step into the world of digital currencies. Exciting!

For this example, we will use a well-known and renowned digital currency exchange that has a gateway from fiat to digital currencies: www.Coinbase.com

1. After signing up, a few steps will be presented (e.g. GDPR compliance notice, privacy policy acknowledgment, and newsletter preferences).
1. After this step, it is required that you verify your email address.
1. After verifying, you will have to add a mobile phone number where you can receive SMS messages (e.g. for confirmation).
1. After clicking 'Send Code,' you will have to fill in the code received in the text sent by Coinbase.
