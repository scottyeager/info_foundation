## Installing the Solar Wallet
There are a number of wallets that can be used to convert XLM into TFT but we found this one to be one of the best and easiest solutions.

Step 1: Download Solar Wallet on your preferred device
For this manual we are going for the desktop wallet for MacOS. Choose yours at [https://solarwallet.io/](https://solarwallet.io/).

Step 2: Install the application. Carefully read the steps you need to take

Step3: Creating an account

Open your Solar wallet and click "Add account." This will take you through the process of creating a new account or importing an already-existing account.

Recommendation:
- Always use a password to secure your account.
- **This is incredibly important!!! When setting up a new account you will be presented with your "secret key." Write down or print this and save it in a safe place.** This is needed for instance when your device breaks down and you wish to re-install the wallet on a new device. Losing this secret key might result in the loss of your account and the funds in it. Neither Solar nor ThreeFold can reset or retrieve the secret key and neither can be held responsible for losing funds at any time. We highly recommend writing the key down rather than storing digitally.

You now have an empty Solar wallet.

## Getting your XLM from Coinbase to Solar Wallet

1. Copy your wallet address from Solar by clicking Receive and clicking on the address or QR Code. (This will copy the address onto your clipboard.)

3. On the right-hand side of your screen, you can now fill in:
- The amount you want to send to your Solar wallet
- Paste the address of your Solar wallet (from step 1)
- Write a memo (can be anything, but is needed to process)
