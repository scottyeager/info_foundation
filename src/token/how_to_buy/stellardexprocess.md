# Buy TFT through Stellar

> Important note: TFTs are not an investment instrument, TFTs are used to buy and sell IT capacity.

Buying TFT (or branded TFT) through Stellar is a bit more of an involved process than the other two options but it shouldn't be too difficult. We've broken it down into two main steps:

### Step One: Use an Exchange to Buy XLM with Fiat

*Note: If you already have XLM, you can skip down to Step Two.*

First, you want to sign up for an exchange with a fiat gateway. Fiat (currency) is the name for euros, dollars, or other government-issued currencies. A fiat gateway allows you to enter the world of digital currencies through depositing fiat currency.

- Liquid has a fiat gateway, so that is a good option. You can find more [here](tft_liquid.md).
- If you cannot use Liquid (e.g. country restriction), feel free to use one of the [exchanges recommended by Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/exchanges). Each of them are reputable and the choice is yours (feel free to do some research). Additionally, they should have clear instructions for signing up and FAQ's.

Next, you'll need to add funds to your wallet and exchange those funds for XLM. You need XLM in order to buy TFT.

- Each exchange will have its own options for depositing fiat – including credit card and bank transfer. Note that credit card payments typically come with a higher fee but tend to be quicker to go through, whereas a bank transfer may take a couple of days but comes with a lower fee or sometimes none at all.
- After you successfully deposit fiat, you will want to exchange that for XLM
- Again, each of these major exchanges will have instructions / an FAQ to help you with this process.

### Step Two: Convert XLM to TFT (or branded TFT)

This part of the process involves:
1. installing a new wallet that can be used to store XLM and buy TFT
2. setting up a trustline for TFT, and
3. exchanging XLM for TFT
