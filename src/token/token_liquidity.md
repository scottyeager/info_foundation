# The Liquidity of TFT

The liquidity of the TF Token is not high today (July 2020).
We expect this liquidity to improve based on the growth of the TFGrid and people using it.

The following items will help drive liquidity:

## Natural Economic Demand

The ThreeFold Grid is the largest decentralized network of capacity in the world. It is attracting developers to build applications that run on its capacity. This is incentivized by many benefits that the users of these applications can enjoy: 100% ownership of their data, superior reliability through decentralized hosting, guaranteed and transparent execution of software through the [Smart Contract for IT](smart_contract_for_it.md), and many more benefits. Developers can rent capacity from the ThreeFold Grid in exchange for TFT (only; no other currencies are used) and this is what creates a natural economic demand. We call this process cultivation.

You can learn more on how to deploy applications and other workloads on the ThreeFold Grid [here](https://cloud.threefold.io/).

> DO NOT EXPECT IMMEDIATE LIQUIDITY. The TFT liquidity will grow as the TFGrid will grow and be used more. 

## We are a drop in the ocean today.

While we might be the largest network today of decentralized capacity its still very small compared to the big centralized cloud vendors. There is a lot of room for growth.

The document about [Grid Valuation](tf_grid_valuation.md) shows how the ThreeFold Grid maybe could grow to a 10% share of the current public cloud market. This would equal 500 billion USD by 2025 and translate to a 50 billion USD demand to utilize the capacity of the TF Grid through TFT as the medium of exchange for capacity. This will eventually drive liquidity.

> WE ARE ONLY AT THE BEGINNING. 

## Staking of TFT: Hoarding VS Velocity 

A complementary currency expert has suggested the following strategy which is based upon the differences between’ hoarding’ & ‘velocity’ based tokens. TF believes it merits serious consideration by the TF Community.

The idea is to promote the hoarding values of our tokens at this early stage and then to later emphasize velocity once the network has reached a critical mass.

More and more blockchain projects use “staking” to improve scarcity. Staking is not a financial trick, it's a very logical process to reward people to hold tokens rather than selling them, how might TF do this?

Farmers receive TF tokens as a reward for making an investment in hardware, the earlier they invest the lower the difficulty factor so the more TFT are farmed. 

Our suggestion is that capacity users will receive substantial discounts on the TFGrid by staking  tokens, which means TFT goes into a wallet which can only be used for buying ThreeFold IT capacity. An example might be, if you need 1k USD capacity per month, but you buy 2 year in advance (24K USD) you get upto 60% discount (9.6K USD).

This is a very logical approach, by buying & staking so many tokens upfront a capacity user basically becomes a co-owner of the already deployed capacity, this way the farmer can already sell some tokens to allow them to pay for their operational expenses and further hardware investment.


## Stability vs Hype: Hoarding Nature of TFT at this point.

Some TFT holders (e.g. as result of farming) might not want to sell their tokens at this point because they expect a further increase in value. This results in a lower liquid amount of TFT. 

> We do not believe in hype or speculation as mechanism to drive ThreeFold or TFT value !

Expectations are proven when the price increases and the valuation can enter a hype cycle that feeds into itself, leading to an economic bubble. While this can lead to big speculative gains for some, these are always the losses of others. TF does not support speculative bubbles and the worsening in global inequalities that can occur as a consequence. Therefore we wont participate in marketing activites that artificially inflate the price of TFT. We believe in a fair evaluation of TFT from the economic demand for the capacity of the TF Grid instead.
