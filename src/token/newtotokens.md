# ThreeFold Token (TFT) for Beginners

While the [Token section](token.md) of this wiki is quite built out, we know that some people visiting here might not have much experience with tokens in general. So, we created a page here to answer some questions which might be coming up for you.

> Important note: TFTs are not an investment instrument. TFTs are used to buy and sell IT capacity.

### Is ThreeFold Token a cryptocurrency?

Yes, technically. We're a digital currency, a digital currency is a currency managed by a blockchain. In case of ThreeFold our TFT lives on the Stellar public blockchain. 
Most people would call our TFT a utility token. Its a token used to buy and sell IT capacity on our TFGrid.


### What is the process for buying ThreeFold Tokens?

You can find the process for TFT in the ["How to Buy" section](how_to_buy_and_sell.md) section.

This is more or less the same for *all* types of digital currencies, particularly when going through an exchange. This isn't exclusive to TFT.

Fundamentally, here is the process of buying TFT through an exchange:

1. Add fiat currency (euros or dollars or similar) into an exchange
2. Convert fiat currency into a digital currency that can be traded with TFT (depends on the exchange)
3. Buy TFT with the trade-able digital currency

To go from fiat currency (euros or dollars or similar) to a digital currency has specific requirements by law which mean that it takes a little bit of time, but only to get set up initially. Once you verify your identity (this process is dependent on your country of residence / origin), you won't need to repeat these steps again.

**It's important to take the process of signing up and buying tokens seriously and to follow all steps carefully.** But as long as you do so, you will be more than fine! While it's nothing to be scared of, you'll need to give it your full attention.

There are many resources online to help you to answer questions.

### Why use a digital currency at all? Why not just euros or dollars?

Using a digital currency on a blockchain has many benefits, its easy to be used by machines as well as by people. Thanks to blockchain technology its super safe and decentralized. In our case the TFT is being created as a result of farmers keeping their computers connected to the internet which creates an economic benefit which is needed to expand the TFGrid, this is not something which can be done by using fiat currencies.

### Is this like Bitcoin?

In some ways yes and in other ways no. They are both digital currencies but they have different purposes and reasons for existing. There are plenty of articles out there explaining Bitcoin. As far as the ThreeFold Token goes, it exists to serve as the medium of exchange on our new internet. So if you want to buy some storage to house your photos, for example, you would be able to do that through the TFT.
