# ThreeFold Token (TFT) for Beginners

While the [Token section](token.md) of this wiki is quite built out, we know that some people visiting here might not have much experience with tokens in general. So, we created a page here to answer some questions which might be coming up for you.

> Important note: TFTs are not an investment instrument.

### Is ThreeFold Token a cryptocurrency?

Yes, technically. We're a digital currency, a medium of exchange on the new internet that we're creating.

We believe that digital ecosystems are the future, & will empower billions around the world. They represent a departure from a centralized economic system fueled by greed and control, propelling us towards a fair and equal society.

### What is the process for buying ThreeFold Tokens?

You can find the process for TFT in the ["How to Buy" section](how_to_buy_and_sell.md) section.

The truth is, there is a process for buying *all* types of digital currencies. This isn't exclusive to TFT.

Fundamentally, here is the process of buying TFT:

1. Add fiat currency (euros or dollars or similar) into an exchange
2. Convert fiat currency into a digital currency that can be traded with TFT (depends on the exchange)
3. Buy TFT with the tradeable digital currency

To go from fiat currency (euros or dollars or similar) to a digital currency has specific requirements by law which mean that it takes a little bit of time, but only to get set up initially. Once you verify your identity (this process is dependent on your country of residence / origin), you won't need to repeat these steps again.

**It's important to take the process of signing up and buying tokens seriously and to follow all steps carefully.** But as long as you do so, you will be more than fine! While it's nothing to be scared of, you'll need to give it your full attention.

There are many resources online to help you to answer questions.

### Why use a digital currency at all? Why not just euros or dollars?

The value of the ThreeFold Grid and its use-cases is largely provided by its [decentralized](true_decentralized_internet_system.md) nature. We believe in the power and autonomy of individuals to be able to collaborate in a peer-to-peer system, where everyone participates with equal privileges.

The beautiful [ecosystem](partners.md) that we are creating would be incomplete without a decentralized currency as a fair and trustworthy medium of exchange for all stakeholders. TFT allows our whole ecosystem to enjoy the [benefits and the fairness](token_features.md) of a decentralized currency. That's why we created the ThreeFold Token (TFT).

### Is this like Bitcoin?

In some ways yes and in other ways no. They are both digital currencies but they have different purposes and reasons for existing. There are plenty of articles out there explaining Bitcoin. As far as the ThreeFold Token goes, it exists to serve as the medium of exchange on our new internet. So if you want to buy some storage to house your photos, for example, you would be able to do that through the TFT.
