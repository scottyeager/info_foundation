# Become A Farmer

Become a farmer and contribute to building the foundation of a better internet for humanity and the planet. By becoming a farmer, a few decisions need to be made:

- do you want to host the hardware yourself?
- do you want your hardware to be hosted?
- do you not even want to own hardware but still farm ThreeFold Tokens?
- do you want to become a certified or a DIY farmer?

# I Want To Own Certified Hardware

## Certified Home and Small Office Nodes Pre-Register

Two of the main ThreeFold Farming Cooperatives (BetterToken & Mazraa) are leading the initiative to spread out the grid further by making hosting a node accessible to all. Combining their strenght they came up with 3 nodes that fit almost any budget.
The nodes will be release in batches of 50 pieces, and pre-registrations for the next batches are now open.

## DIY Farming

If you like to setup your farm yourself without the help from a ThreeFold cooperative you ether 

- Purchase standard INTEL or AMD based server hardware - new or if used not older than 4 years

- Purchase certified hardware in a configuration which is optimized for token earning and security. Which configurations are certified and where you can buy them can be found [here](hpe.md)

**Only the purchase of certified hardware will give you the option to become a certified farmer.**

Both of the 'set up your own farm' options mean that you need some technical expertise to create your own farm and add your node(s) to the ThreeFold Grid. Details can be found [here](https://sdk.threefold.io/#/farm_setup_management)

# I Do Not Want To Own Hardware

## Cloud Farming

Multiple Farming Cooperatives are working on a model where it's made possible to farm TFT and add capacity to the grid without have to put any hardware inside your home.

More info on Cloud Farming will follow soon.
